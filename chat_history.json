You want me to create a plan for building a production-ready mobile app called \"Sneaker Vault\" with the tagline \"Track. Showcase. Connect.\" for AvaResearchLLC. It will be a sneaker collection management and social networking platform, similar to Instagram but tailored for sneaker enthusiasts, with collection management, marketplace features, and potential XRP Ledger integration.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Collection Management:** Allow users to add sneakers to their virtual collection, including details like model, colorway, purchase price, condition, and photos.\n*   **Showcase/Feed:** Implement a visually appealing feed where users can showcase their sneaker collections and view other users' collections. This will be the primary social space.\n*   **Marketplace:** Enable users to list sneakers for sale, browse listings, and potentially integrate with the XRP Ledger for secure transactions and verification.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#1976D2` (A classic blue for primary actions and branding)\n    *   Secondary: `#4CAF50` (A vibrant green for accent and positive actions)\n    *   Accent: `#FFC107` (A bright yellow for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Light blue for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable experience.\n\nNow, let's create the initial files and components.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create basic tab structure:** Create the basic tab structure for the app using the existing tab navigation. The tabs should be \"Collection\", \"Showcase\", and \"Marketplace\".\n2.  **Implement Collection Screen:** Create a basic UI for the \"Collection\" screen where users can view their added sneakers.\n3.  **Implement Showcase Screen:** Create a basic UI for the \"Showcase\" screen to display a feed of sneaker collections.\n4.  **Implement Marketplace Screen:** Create a basic UI for the \"Marketplace\" screen to display sneaker listings.\n5.  **Remove demo content:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nOkay, let's start by creating the tab structure and basic UI for each screen.\n\nAfter you implement the plan, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-24T23:54:41.428154"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Sneaker Vault app!
